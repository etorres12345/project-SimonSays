# Simon-Says Memory Game

4 different colored buttons appear on the client screen. Hit start to initiate the game and you are taken to the game screen. The game then generates it's first sequence and the user has to then match the computer's sequence. If the user correctly matches the computer sequence then they move on to the next level. The next level increases difficulty by displaying another randomly generated button that the user has to match. The sequence keeps growing as the user passes the levels always adding to the previous sequence. Once the user's sequence doesn't match the game's sequence the game ends and the use is taken to the end screen where a restart button is shown. The user can click on this restart button and is taken back to the start screen.
